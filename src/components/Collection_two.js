If youâ€™re left feeling lonely, self-conscious or simply not enough, you, just like everyone else at some point in their journey, have come to experience the compare-and-despair effect of social media and its negative impacts on mental health. We will be utilizing various channels such as Twitter spaces and Discord, to create support systems for the community to share, connect and help one another with occasional speakers on a specific community selected topic.",

Social media is a powerful tool connecting us all around the globe which can still be used for its true purpose of enabling connections, expressing creativity and being inspired. Happiness is created by you and your mind. Reconnect with your body and recognize it for the journey it's been through. It starts with self-assurance and maybe even cleansing your social feeds once in a while. There are still many great influencers who truly work hard to brighten your mood.",
